## 2. Core Functionalities

The Simple Android Library implements several core functionalities that form the backbone of the application. Each feature is designed to meet the specific needs of educational institutions while maintaining simplicity and reliability.

### a. Book Management

The book management system provides essential functionality for handling library resources. The system is built around a structured data model that captures all necessary book information:

```kotlin
data class Book(
    val id: String,
    val title: String,
    val author: String,
    val isbn: String,
    val publicationYear: Int,
    val description: String,
    val category: String,
    val status: BookStatus,
    val location: String
)
```

Key features include:
- Adding new books with automatic ID generation
- Editing existing book information
- Deleting books with dependency checks
- ISBN validation to ensure data integrity
- Category management for organized collections
- Status tracking (Available, Borrowed, Reserved)
- Location management for physical book placement
- Search functionality with filters for title, author, and ISBN

The system implements validation rules to maintain data integrity:
- Required field validation
- ISBN format verification
- Publication year range checking
- Duplicate entry prevention
- Category validation

### b. User Management

The user management system handles all aspects of library user administration through a role-based approach:

```kotlin
data class User(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val email: String,
    val role: UserRole,
    val maxBorrowLimit: Int,
    val active: Boolean
)

enum class UserRole {
    STUDENT,
    FACULTY,
    STAFF,
    ADMIN
}
```

Features include:
- User registration with unique ID generation
- Profile management (name, email, contact information)
- Role-based access control
- Borrowing limit enforcement based on user role
- Account status tracking (active/inactive)
- User search and filtering capabilities

The system enforces different borrowing limits based on user roles:
- Students: 3 books maximum
- Faculty: 5 books maximum
- Staff: 4 books maximum
- Admins: Unlimited access

### c. Borrowing and Returning

The borrowing system manages book circulation with a focus on preventing conflicts and maintaining accurate records:

```kotlin
data class BorrowRecord(
    val id: String,
    val bookId: String,
    val userId: String,
    val borrowDate: LocalDateTime,
    val dueDate: LocalDateTime,
    val returnDate: LocalDateTime?,
    val status: BorrowStatus
)
```

Key features include:
- Borrowing process with automatic due date calculation
- Return processing with status updates
- Overdue tracking and notifications
- Fine calculation for late returns
- Borrowing limit enforcement
- Book availability checking
- Conflict prevention (preventing duplicate borrows)

The system implements several safeguards:
- Prevents borrowing if user has reached their limit
- Prevents borrowing if book is already checked out
- Automatically calculates due dates based on user role
- Tracks book status changes
- Maintains borrowing history

### d. Statistics and Reporting

The application provides basic statistical analysis to help library staff make informed decisions:

Book Statistics:
- Most borrowed books
- Popular categories
- Availability rates
- New additions tracking

User Statistics:
- Active users count
- Borrowing patterns

- User engagement metrics

The statistics are presented through:
- Simple list views for most borrowed books
- Basic charts for category distribution
- Tabular data for user statistics
- Summary views for key metrics

Data Collection:
- Real-time tracking of borrowing activities
- Automatic calculation of statistics
- Daily updates of key metrics
- Historical data maintenance

## 3. User Interface and Experience

The application's user interface is designed with Material Design 3 principles, ensuring a modern and intuitive experience. The UI is optimized for both phones and tablets, with responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

### Layout and Navigation

The main interface follows a hierarchical navigation structure:

- Bottom Navigation Bar

### Theme Implementation

The application supports both light and dark themes with a simple toggle mechanism:

```kotlin
class ThemeManager {
    fun toggleTheme() {
        val currentTheme = getCurrentTheme()
        val newTheme = if (currentTheme == ThemeMode.LIGHT) 
            ThemeMode.DARK else ThemeMode.LIGHT
        applyTheme(newTheme)
        saveThemePreference(newTheme)
    }
}
```

Theme features:
- Automatic system theme detection
- Manual theme toggle in settings
- Theme persistence using SharedPreferences
- Smooth transition animations
- Consistent color scheme across themes

### Language Support

Multi-language support is implemented through Android's resource system:

- Resource-based string management
  ```xml
  <!-- strings.xml (English) -->
  <string name="book_title">Book Title</string>
  <string name="author">Author</string>

  <!-- strings.xml (Greek) -->
  <string name="book_title">Τίτλος Βιβλίου</string>
  <string name="author">Συγγραφέας</string>
  ```

Language switching:
- Language selection in settings
- Runtime locale change
- RTL layout support
- Date and number formatting
- Currency display

### Notification System

The notification system handles various library events:

Due Date Reminders:
- Configurable reminder timing
- Daily notifications for upcoming due dates
- Overdue alerts
- Return confirmation

System Updates:
- New book notifications
- System maintenance alerts
- User account updates
- Fine payment reminders

Notification Implementation:
```kotlin
class NotificationManager {
    fun scheduleDueDateReminder(bookId: String, dueDate: LocalDateTime) {
        val notification = createDueDateNotification(bookId, dueDate)
        notificationManager.schedule(notification, dueDate.minusDays(1))
    }
}
```

Notification Features:
- Priority-based delivery
- Action buttons (Renew, Pay Fine)
- Notification grouping
- Silent mode support
- User preference management

## 4. Technical Architecture

The application follows modern Android development practices with a clear separation of concerns and maintainable architecture.

### Application Structure

The app uses a traditional View-based architecture with Activities and Fragments:

```kotlin
// Main Activity Structure
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
    private val viewModel: MainViewModel by viewModels()
    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        setupNavigation()
    }
}
```

Key Components:
- Activities for main screens
- Fragments for modular UI components
- ViewBinding for view access
- Navigation component for screen management
- Bottom navigation for main sections
- Navigation drawer for additional features

### Design Pattern

The application implements MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:

```kotlin
// ViewModel Example
class BookViewModel(
    private val repository: BookRepository
) : ViewModel() {
    private val _books = MutableLiveData<List<Book>>()
    val books: LiveData<List<Book>> = _books

    fun loadBooks() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            _books.value = repository.getAllBooks()
        }
    }
}
```

Architecture Components:
- ViewModels for UI state management
- LiveData for observable data
- Repository pattern for data operations
- Coroutines for asynchronous tasks
- Dependency injection for component management

### Data Storage

Room database is used for local data persistence:

```kotlin
@Database(
    entities = [Book::class, User::class, BorrowRecord::class],
    version = 7
)
abstract class LibraryDatabase : RoomDatabase() {
    abstract fun bookDao(): BookDao
    abstract fun userDao(): UserDao
    abstract fun borrowDao(): BorrowDao
}
```

Database Features:
- Entity relationships
- Type converters
- Migration strategies
- Indexing for performance
- Transaction support
- Backup and restore

### Code Organization

The project follows a feature-based package structure:
